Explanation:
1. Concat1 :
In this method,
 we pass a string “Geeks” and perform
 “s1 = s1 + ”forgeeks”. The string passed from main() is not changed,
  this is due to the fact that String is immutable.
   Altering the value of string creates another object and s1 in concat1()
   stores reference of new string. References s1 in main()
   and cocat1() refer to different strings.

2. Concat2 :
In this method, we pass a string “Geeks” and perform “s2.append(“forgeeks”)”
which changes the actual value of the string (in main) to “Geeksforgeeks”.
This is due to the simple fact that StringBuilder is mutable and hence changes its value.

2. Concat3 :
StringBuffer is similar to StringBuilder except one difference
that StringBuffer is thread safe,
i.e., multiple threads can use it without any issue.
The thread safety brings a penalty of performance.
When to use which one :

If a string is going to remain constant throughout the program,
then use String class object because a String object is immutable.

If a string can change (example: lots of logic and operations in the construction of the string)
and will only be accessed from a single thread, using a StringBuilder is good enough.

If a string can change, and will be accessed from multiple threads,
 use a StringBuffer because StringBuffer is synchronous so you have thread-safety.
